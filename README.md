# Data-Analysis-with-Excel

Data Analysis Project of Listings123 (an Airbnb-type company) data using Excel to clean, explore, and draw insights from the large data set (over 50,000 unique rows), then using PowerPoint to explain insights and present data-based recommendations to help solve business problem(s).

These projects were a part of my coursework for Intro to Data Analytics class offered by NYU Tandon School of Engineering and Pathstream.
