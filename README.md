# Data-Analysis-with-Excel

Data Analysis Projects using Excel to clean, explore, and draw insights from large data sets, then using PowerPoint to showcase recommendations from those insights to help solve business problem(s).

These projects were a part of my coursework for Intro to Data Analytics class offered by NYU Tandon School of Engineering and Pathstream.
